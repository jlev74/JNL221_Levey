		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>

		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<!-- Insert your h3 and p tags, with your text inside, here: --> <h3> Hip hop vocabulary</h3> 
		<p> The data for the project comes from listening to different hip hop rappers and their lyrics to pick out how many unique words each of them have. The first dataviz element in the article is an intereactive scatterplot that has every artist's face and it says their name, and the number of words that they have in their first 35,000 words. The second dataviz is a stacked column chart with the hip hop artist's highlighted in a different color to differentiate by era. And the third piece of dataviz is an area column chart that compares unique lyrics in Country, Rock and Hip Hop songs.</p>

		<p> The key message of the dataviz project is to display the creativity of the Hip Hop genre. Within the genre, artists can use pretty much any assortment of words, as well as make up their own. One way that this dataviz is effective is putting a face to how many unique words are used. By showing who the artists is, viewers can get a better look at who uses the most unique words. The stacked column chart is also effective because separating the artists into their eras helps visualize when using more unique words started growing in usage. And the third dataviz chart is effective because with showing the overlay of unique word usage throughout different genres shows how unique Hip Hop really is. </p>

		<p> The dataviz is visceral because looking at the interactive scatter plot with the artists' faces on it and the stacked column having all the names, fans of each artists can see where they ranked against other artists. Being able to see and find their own favorite artist is more personal to people because seeing names not super memorable, but being able to see every artist's face, is more memorable and unique to look at. People in general have a deeper connection to pictures than they do written out names. 





		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: --> <iframe title="2020 United States Active Troops " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-qJqXL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qJqXL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="410"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
